# Bare-Metal MCU Drivers (STM32) ----  IN PROGRESS

This repository contains bare-metal peripheral drivers written from scratch
for STM32 microcontrollers.

## Implemented Drivers
- Clock (RCC)
- GPIO (input/output, pull-up/down)

## Goals
- No HAL
- Register-level control
- Hardware-verified on STM32F103

## Tools
- ARM GCC
- STM32CubeIDE
- ST-Link
